        <p data-anime="800" class="ign-text fadeInLeft">"This idea of gameplay-derived storytelling is what Life is Strange fully commits to. All the rote action mechanics of the past game are gone, and so are the overwhelming sci-fi cityscapes and grand corporate conspiracies. This game swerves down a different path in order to give gamers a more personal story, played with the accessible mechanics of an adventure game. Here, you simply play as a teenage girl coping with life in a quiet town. <br> Over the course of the game, you do find that Max is no ordinary girl, and that Arcadia Bay is a very strange town, but even as the mystery ratchets up, the roots of everyday life remain. <br> Max will discover a fantastical ability in the game, but for players, the most powerful tool to wield will be good sense in listening and observing what's going on around you, because your choices will ultimately be what leads you to the end of the game."</p>

        <p data-anime="800" class="pcworld-text fadeInLeft">"When Telltale first released The Walking Dead, I remember I had this feeling like, “Sure, dialogue and/or choice-driven stories work pretty well when the stakes are life-and-death, but I don’t think it would be near as compelling without the threat of the apocalypse.”
          Life is Strange is the game that tries to prove me wrong. You play as Maxine “Max” Caulfield, a teenage girl at the prestigious Blackwell Academy—a private boarding school in small-town Arcadia Bay, Oregon."</p>
